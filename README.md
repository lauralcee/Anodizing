[What Is Anodizing?](https://hjyhardware.com/what-is-anodizing-what-are-the-advantages-of-anodizing/)
Anodizing is an electrochemical process that converts the metal surface into a decorative, durable, corrosion-resistant, anodic oxide finish. Aluminum is ideally suited to anodizing, although other nonferrous metals, such as magnesium and titanium, also can be anodized.
An electrochemical process that involves coating a metal part with an oxide surface layer, anodizing gives the part additional sturdiness and a more attractive finish. While anodizing is most common with aluminum, other substrates can be anodized, including magnesium and titanium .
